# Apt Check for Updates

Recommend creating a crontab for this script, that way you can ignore this until a certain time

For example (change with wherever you want the script):

- `0 23 * * 0 konsole -e sh $HOME/Documents/scripts/apt-check-for-updates.sh`
  - This runs every Sunday at 23:00 (11 pm)
